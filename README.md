# Setup
To run tasks in browser open corresponding index.html file from folders exercise-1 and exercise-2.

To run tests for the first exercise open file test.html from tests folder in browser.

# Notes
Since 'https://5dc588200bbd050014fb8ae1.mockapi.io/assessment' failed to work I changed api to get users to 'https://reqres.in/api/users'. It provides similar data, but there are no fields 'name' and 'createdAt'. I changed name field to aggregate content from fields first_name and last_name and replaced createdAt with email.
